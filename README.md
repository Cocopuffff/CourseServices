Java Assessment
●	What did you like about this project?

I liked the fact that this project is really challenging and pushed me to my limit. I think the pre-release gave us time to understand the complex relationships between different classes.

●	What did you struggle with in this project?

I had some difficulty debugging my codes, but I am glad that I had just enough time to debug all of them.

●	What would make your experience with this assessment better?

I think this assessment's timeline was quite rushed because we only started teaching OOP on Monday and the assessment is on Friday. I previously had time to revise course materials for JavaScript, HTML & CSS. But I didn't have time to do so for Java. I am glad that I managed to fully understand the OOP concepts taught in 2 days.
